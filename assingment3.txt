1. explaing the architecture of nodejs

Ans-Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It is an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop architecture.

This architecture consists of the following components:

1. Event Loop: The event loop is the core of Node.js. It is responsible for processing asynchronous I/O operations, such as handling requests from the browser, executing database queries, and interacting with the file system.

2. Callback Queue: Asynchronous operations are placed in a queue and are executed one by one.

3. JavaScript/V8 Engine: The JavaScript/V8 engine is responsible for running the code written in JavaScript. It compiles the code and executes it.

4. Libuv: Libuv is responsible for managing the event loop and the callback queue. It also provides an API for interacting with the operating system.

5. HTTP Server: The HTTP server is responsible for handling incoming requests and sending responses.

Example: 
Let’s consider a simple example of a web server written in Node.js. When a user sends a request to
-------------------------------------------------------------------
2.explain the feature of nodejs like non-blocking, synchronous, single threaded.


Ans-Non-blocking: Node.js is non-blocking, meaning that code will not be blocked from execution while waiting for a response from a database or other resource. This makes Node.js applications highly concurrent, allowing for more efficient and effective use of resources.

Synchronous: Node.js is synchronous, meaning that all code is executed in the order it is written. This makes it easier to write and maintain code, since the code's order of execution is always the same.

Single Threaded: Node.js is single-threaded, meaning that all code runs in a single thread. This allows Node.js to be highly efficient when running multiple concurrent requests, since each request can be handled in the same thread.

3. create a array and object in javascript and print it.
// Array
let fruits = ["apple", "orange", "banana"];

// Object
let car = {
  model: "BMW ",
  color: "white",
  year: 2021
};

// Print
console.log(fruits); 
console.log(car);

4.Nowadays how data is transferred between server and client?(explain about json)

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format used to transfer data between a server and a client. It is an open standard format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs. It is used primarily to transmit data between a server and web application, as an alternative to XML. JSON is also used for exchanging data between different types of applications, such as web, mobile, and desktop applications. JSON syntax is relatively easy to learn and its structure is simple, making it a popular choice for data transfer.

5.write program to show how to append, pop and sort elements in array in javascript.

//Append elements in array

var array = ["apple", "mango", "banana"];

// adding elements to the array
array.push("strawberry"); 

//Pop elements in array
array.pop(); 

//Sort elements in array
array.sort();
---------------------------------------
6. why should we use let in place of var in our javascript programs?
ans-
Let offers improved readability, better block scoping, and more concise syntax compared to var. Let also allows us to create variables that are limited to only the block they are declared in, while var variables are declared in the global scope and can be accessed anywhere. 
This means that let variables are less prone to accidental overwriting and are more secure.

7. explain about all the primitive data types in javascript

Primitive data types in JavaScript are the basic data types that are used to construct all other data types. They include:

1. Number: A numeric value.

2. String: A sequence of characters.

3. Boolean: A logical value that is either true or false.

4. Null: An empty value.

5. Undefined: A value that has not been defined.

6. Symbol: A unique identifier.

These primitive data types are the building blocks of all other data types, including objects, arrays, and functions.
